This algorithm creates an nxm matrix that:
- The value of each element in the first row is the number of the column.
- The value of each element in the first column is the number of the row.
- The rest of the elements each has a value equal to the sum of the element above it and element to the left.
- The function must return a sensible error if the user does not input exactly two arguments
- The function should be well commented


function [A] = specialMatrix(n,m)

% This function should return a matrix A as described in the problem statement

% Inputs n is the number of rows, and m the number of columns

% It is recomended to first create the matrxix A of the correct size, filling it with zeros to start with is not a bad choice

if nargin~=2;

    error('Needs two inputs');

end

A = zeros(n,m); % Makes matrix zero

for i=1:n

    for j=1:m
    
        if i==1
        
        A(i,j)=j;
        
        elseif j==1
        
            A(i,j)=i
            
        else
        
            A(i,j)=A(i-1,j)+A(i,j-1)
            
    end
    
end


end
